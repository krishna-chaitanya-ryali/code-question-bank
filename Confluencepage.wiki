Back-End Implementation: Query, Python Service, and API Development for Security Reports

Description:
Carry out all backend development for the Super Admin Security Reports feature:

1. Database Query Preparation

Prepare optimized SQL queries for fetching security data for all dashboards and selected dashboards.

Validate queries on test data.



2. Python Service Development

Build Python services to execute queries, transform data, and generate Excel reports.

Ensure output matches existing format.



3. API Development & Integration

Develop REST API endpoints for Generic and Individual report download.

Integrate with Python services and enforce Super Admin access control.



4. Testing & Deployment

Perform unit testing of queries, Python logic, and APIs.

Conduct integration testing with UI.

Deploy to QA/UAT and verify with front-end team.




Acceptance Criteria:

Queries return accurate and complete data.

APIs generate Excel reports identical to current per-dashboard reports.

Endpoints secured and tested successfully.

Backend changes signed off after UAT testing.
