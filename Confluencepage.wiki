Subject: Request for Production Update – RAP Metric Details

Hi Sanket,

Good Afternoon.

One of the RAP users has raised a concern regarding missing metrics. I investigated the issue and identified the root cause. I have prepared the required SQL queries to update the RAP_METRIC_DETAILS table.

Since I don’t have the necessary access to run queries on the production environment, I request your support in executing these queries on production. I will share the prepared queries with you for reference.

Please let me know once the updates are done, or if you need any clarification from my side.

Thanks for your help.

Best Regards,
Krishna Chaitanya
