I understand. This activity is actually a repeated effort for us as well — we had to run the same DB scripts earlier on old Dev/UAT and then again on the new servers. Since it’s a purely manual process with large queries, there is always a higher chance of small misses.

That said, we’ll tighten the checks going forward and work together to close these quickly, so it doesn’t affect timelines.
