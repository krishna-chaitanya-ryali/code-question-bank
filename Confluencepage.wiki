Jira Sub-Task: Large Excel Data Download Issue (504 Gateway Timeout)

Summary:
Investigate and fix 504 Gateway Timeout error while downloading large Security Access Reports.

Description:
During UAT, we observed that downloading Security Access Reports with very large datasets (approx. 1.6 lakh+ records) results in a 504 Gateway Timeout error.

Smaller datasets (up to ~5,000 records) work fine.

Larger datasets fail due to long processing and response time.

Root Cause (Initial Analysis):

Current implementation generates Excel synchronously within the request cycle.

For huge data sets, backend processing exceeds server timeout (6 minutes) leading to 504 error.

Proposed Fix:

Implement an asynchronous Excel generation process (background job).

Return a download link once the file is ready.

Store generated files in FOLDER_EXCEL directory with proper cleanup policy.

Acceptance Criteria:

User can trigger download for large datasets without timeout.

User receives notification / download link once file is ready.

Excel download works for both small and large datasets consistently.

Priority: High (as business needs full data export).
