Subject: Sprint 40 Ticket Assignment Request

Hi Nitin,

As part of Sprint 40 planning, I would like to request the following ticket assignments since I will be on leave tomorrow and may not be available during the Sprint call:

1. KMIT-1249 – Code changes and deployments for Master Metric ID alignment

The data fixes were completed in the current Sprint, and I would like to continue with the code changes and deployments in Sprint 40.

Request: Assign this ticket to me.



2. KMIT-1251 – Backend implementation: Query, Python service, and API development for Security Report

This is a continuation of the work done in KMIT-308.

Request: Assign this ticket to me.



3. KMIT-1250 – UI enhancements: Add Report tab in Super Admin page for Security Access Report

This ticket covers the front-end changes required for my backend ticket (KMIT-1251).

Request: Assign this ticket to Prasad.




Please ensure these are considered during tomorrow’s Sprint call so that we have the right assignments in place for Sprint 40.

Thanks,
Krishna Chaitanya
