Jira Ticket: Production Deployment â€“ Security Access Report Enhancement

Summary:
Deployment of Security Access Report Excel download functionality (Back-end + Front-end changes).

Description:
We have implemented a new enhancement to allow generation and download of Security Access Reports in Excel format. The changes include:

Backend (Flask)

Added API endpoint /get_security_access_report for Excel report preparation.

Added API endpoint /download_excel/<filename> for secure file streaming.

Enhanced existing functions download_excel_report and load_data to support dynamic rmm_id inputs.


Frontend (JavaScript)

Integrated AJAX call to /get_security_access_report.

Implemented Excel download logic using /download_excel/<filename>.

User now gets a seamless download of reports with success/failure messages.



Tasks for Deployment Team (DBA/DevOps):

1. Deploy updated Python Flask backend code to production server.


2. Deploy updated JavaScript front-end changes.


3. Ensure FOLDER_EXCEL directory exists and has proper write permissions.


4. Validate database connectivity for query execution.


5. Perform smoke test:

Trigger Security Access Report download for a sample rmm_id.

Verify Excel file is generated and downloaded successfully.




Rollback Plan:
Revert to previous Flask and JavaScript versions from last stable release.
