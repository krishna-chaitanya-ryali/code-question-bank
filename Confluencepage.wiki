Current Setup (as you described)

Table: user_tab

Existing columns: user_id, user_name, email_id, rap_status, packbuilder_status

New columns:

line_manager_id (PSID of Line Manager)

line_manager_name

line_manager_mail

You already have a working LDAP3 script that can:

Take a single PSID

Query the AD (Active Directory)

Fetch attributes like name, mail, and HSBC-AD-LineManagerID

That works for one user.

Now you want to automate this for 2,000‚Äì3,000 users efficiently, fetching and updating their line manager info in user_tab.

üöÄ The Goal

Efficiently loop through all users, fetch their line manager info from AD, and update your DB table ‚Äî without overloading AD or the database, and without taking hours.

üí° Recommended Optimized Approach

Here‚Äôs a clean, scalable, and robust approach:

Step 1: Fetch All Users From DB

You can fetch only the PSIDs (user IDs) that need manager info:

cursor.execute("""
    SELECT user_id 
    FROM user_tab 
    WHERE line_manager_id IS NULL
""")
psid_list = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]

Step 2: Use a Pooled or Batched LDAP Query

Instead of querying LDAP one user at a time (which is slow), use batch processing.

You can process 100‚Äì200 users at once to:

Reduce round-trips to AD

Avoid LDAP timeouts or throttling

Using con.extend.standard.paged_search() from ldap3 helps handle larger sets efficiently.

Example:

from ldap3 import Server, Connection, ALL, NTLM, SUBTREE

server = Server("ldap://your-ldap-server", get_info=ALL)
conn = Connection(server, user="DOMAIN\\username", password="yourpassword", authentication=NTLM, auto_bind=True)

batch_size = 200
for i in range(0, len(psid_list), batch_size):
    batch = psid_list[i:i+batch_size]
    search_filter = "(|(sAMAccountName=" + ")(sAMAccountName=".join(batch) + "))"

    conn.search(
        search_base="DC=yourdomain,DC=com",
        search_filter=search_filter,
        search_scope=SUBTREE,
        attributes=["sAMAccountName", "displayName", "mail", "HSBC-AD-LineManagerID"]
    )

    for entry in conn.entries:
        psid = str(entry.sAMAccountName)
        manager_id = str(entry['HSBC-AD-LineManagerID']) if 'HSBC-AD-LineManagerID' in entry else None
        manager_name = str(entry.displayName) if 'displayName' in entry else None
        manager_mail = str(entry.mail) if 'mail' in entry else None

        # You can prepare an update batch for DB here

Step 3: Batch Update the DB

Rather than updating row by row, collect results in a list and do bulk updates (e.g., every 500 records):

update_data = []

for entry in conn.entries:
    update_data.append((manager_id, manager_name, manager_mail, psid))

if update_data:
    cursor.executemany("""
        UPDATE user_tab
        SET line_manager_id = %s,
            line_manager_name = %s,
            line_manager_mail = %s
        WHERE user_id = %s
    """, update_data)
    connection.commit()


This drastically improves performance vs single-row updates.

‚öôÔ∏è Further Optimizations

Parallelization (Optional)
If AD and DB can handle it, you can use concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize LDAP fetches by splitting PSIDs into chunks.

Error Handling & Logging
Wrap LDAP queries in try/except blocks, and log failed PSIDs to retry later.

Incremental Updates
Store a flag or timestamp in the DB after each batch update, so if the script fails midway, you can resume from where you left off.

Dry Run Mode
Before writing to DB, print or log what updates will happen. Helpful for verification.
