Subject: Request for Production Update – RAP Metric Details (ERRSD-2256)

Hi Sanket,

Good Afternoon.

One of the RAP users raised a concern (Ticket ID: ERRSD-2256) regarding missing metrics in the HB-EG dashboard for the month of July. After investigating, I identified the root cause and prepared the required SQL queries to update the RAP_METRIC_DETAILS table. The issue is related to the Risk Type “Financial Reporting and Tax Risk.”

Since I don’t have access to execute queries on the production environment, I request your help in running these queries in production. I will share the prepared queries with you for reference.

Please let me know once the updates are completed or if you need any additional clarifications from my side.

Thanks for your support.
