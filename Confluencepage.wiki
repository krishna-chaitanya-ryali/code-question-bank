Implementation Plan (CR â€“ Jenkins Pipelines Execution)

Pre-Checks:

Ensure all DB changes (as per CR#1) have been successfully applied in Production.

Verify Jenkins pipeline configurations are updated and pointing to correct Git branch.

Confirm with application and DBA teams that the environment is ready for deployment.

Steps to Implement:

Trigger DR Pipeline

Log in to Jenkins with authorized credentials.

Run the Disaster Recovery (DR) pipeline.

Validate successful build and deployment with no errors.

Trigger Production Pipeline

Once DR pipeline completes, execute the Production pipeline.

Monitor build logs and deployment status in Jenkins.

Verify DB Changes with Latest Code

Validate that the application is picking up the newly applied DB changes.

Run basic sanity checks on the application UI and APIs.

Confirm schema-level changes are correctly reflected in code execution.

Post-Deployment Testing

Coordinate with QA/Business team to run functional validations.

Confirm incremental data load feature is working as expected.

Closure

If testing is successful, mark CR as Implemented and update status.

Share final confirmation email with stakeholders.

Success Criteria:

Both DR and Production pipelines execute successfully.

Application runs without errors and reflects the latest DB + code changes.

Backout Plan:

If DR pipeline fails, do not proceed with Production pipeline.

If Production pipeline fails or app issues are found:

Stop application services.

Roll back to last successful Jenkins build (previous stable version).

Notify stakeholders and DBA team immediately.
