Subject: Successful Deployment â€“ Timestamp Data Type Conversion (Production)

Dear All,

I am pleased to inform you that the Timestamp Data Type Conversion activity has been successfully deployed in Production.

All planned database schema updates and data conversions (conversion of CREAT_DT and UPDT_DT fields from VARCHAR to TIMESTAMP) were executed as per the schedule.

Corresponding Python application code changes were also deployed.

Post-deployment validations confirmed that data conversion and application functionalities are working as expected.

About the Change:
Previously, date and time fields were stored as VARCHAR in several tables, leading to data inconsistencies and limited querying capability.
With this deployment, these fields are now stored as proper TIMESTAMP data types, ensuring:

Better accuracy and consistency in date handling.

Standardized storage across all impacted tables.

Improved performance for queries and reporting.

I would also like to thank Srikanth and Devar Bhoina for their support with schema backup and DBA activities during this release.

Next Steps:

Please validate your respective functionalities and confirm.

Any issues observed should be reported immediately so they can be addressed.

This is a significant step towards improving data integrity and reliability in the RAP application.

Best Regards,
R Krishna Chaitanya
