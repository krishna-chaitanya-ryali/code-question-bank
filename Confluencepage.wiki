Title:
Enhancement: API for Generic & Individual Security Reports in Super Admin Page

Description:
Enhance backend services to support the download of Security Access Reports in the Super Admin page, similar to how announcements are managed. This includes:

Generic Report: Download all dashboards’ security reports combined in one Excel.

Individual Report: Download security report(s) for one or multiple selected dashboards (packs).


Scope / Requirements:

Develop API endpoints to:

1. Fetch Generic Report (all dashboards).


2. Fetch Individual Report(s) based on selected dashboards (one or multiple).



Generate Excel output using the same format as the existing individual dashboard security report.

Ensure API handles multiple selections efficiently.

Implement proper access control to restrict feature to Super Admins only.

Ensure optimal performance for large datasets.


Acceptance Criteria:

API provides two endpoints: Generic and Individual report download.

Excel formatting is identical to current per-dashboard reports.

Supports multiple dashboard selection.

Proper error handling (e.g., no dashboards selected, access denied, server issues).

Tested for large volume of dashboards.


Dependencies:

Existing per-dashboard report generation logic.

Security/authorization module.
