Summary: DBA Support Required – Execute Queries on RAP_METRIC_DETAILS (ERRSD-2256)

Description:
As part of Jira Ticket ERRSD-2256, a user reported missing metrics in the HB-EG dashboard for the month of July, related to the Risk Type “Financial Reporting and Tax Risk.”

I have identified the issue and prepared the required SQL queries to update the RAP_METRIC_DETAILS table. Since I don’t have access to run queries on the production database, we require DBA assistance to execute these queries.

Action Required:

Execute the attached SQL queries in the production database.

Confirm once the queries are successfully executed.


Additional Notes:

The queries have been tested in the lower environment and are working as expected.

Please let me know if you need further details or clarifications.
