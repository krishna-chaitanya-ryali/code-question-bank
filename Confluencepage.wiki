Subject: Request for Latest PyCharm Installation or Debugger Patch

Description:
While working on my Python projects, I am facing an issue with PyCharm debugger. Normal run works fine, but when I try to run in debug mode, it fails with the following error:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'imp'

Details:

Current PyCharm version available in HSBC Software Center: PyCharm Community Edition 2020.x

Current Python version in use: Python 3.12

The issue occurs because PyCharm 2020 uses the deprecated imp module, which has been removed from Python 3.12.

This makes debugging impossible in the current setup.


Request:

Kindly provide the latest version of PyCharm (2024.x or higher) that is compatible with Python 3.12.
OR

If upgrade is not possible, please apply a patch to the current PyCharm installation by replacing deprecated imp references with importlib in the PyCharm debugger helper files.


Impact:

I am unable to debug Python applications, which is critical for development and troubleshooting.
