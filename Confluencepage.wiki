Thanks for highlighting this. These changes were updated on the new evergreening server last Friday, and we had to execute around 600 lines of manual SQL, so a few misses can happen. I didn’t see nulls in the risk management meet table, but there is one in rapidity testing, which might have been overlooked while handling multiple parallel tasks.

Since DB null checks are still manual on 25.2 tables, let’s keep collaborating on such findings — we’ll fix them as they come up. Appreciate your support.
