Hi Team,

We have the Incremental Data Load implementation for RAP scheduled on Saturday, 27th Sept, with CR start time at 10:00 AM. Please find the plan and timings:

10:00 â€“ 10:45 AM â†’ DB schema backup (approx. 30â€“45 mins)

10:45 AM â€“ 01:00 PM â†’ Execute all required DB queries (approx. 2â€“3 hours)

After 01:00 PM â†’ Restart RAP server & run the pipelines (services will come up automatically after pipelines run)


ðŸ‘‰ Requesting DBA support during the backup and DB changes window.
