Production Deployment – Checklist

Hi Team,

Since everyone will now be involved in production deployments, please follow the below checklist to ensure smooth and error-free deployments:

✅ Pre-Deployment Steps

1. UAT Sign-off – Raise a UAT sign-off request at least 3 days before the planned deployment date.


2. GitHub Branches – Once UAT sign-off is received, prepare the required GitHub branches for deployment.


3. DB Schema Backup – Raise a ticket in the PNDA JIRA board requesting a schema backup from the DBA team.


4. RAP JIRA Notifications – Turn on notifications in the RAP JIRA board to monitor any issues during/after deployment.


5. TPAM Approvals – If TPAM links are required, get them approved 24 hours before the scheduled deployment start time.



✅ Post-Deployment Steps

1. Close the CR – Immediately close the Change Request (CR) after successful deployment.


2. Send Confirmation Mail – Inform stakeholders that the deployment was successful.


3. Turn Off Notifications – Disable the notifications in the web application after deployment.
