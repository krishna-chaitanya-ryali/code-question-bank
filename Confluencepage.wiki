Title: Incorrect error message displayed when mandatory fields are missing during metric submission

Description:
When submitting a metric (either using Save as Draft or Submit as Final) without filling in the mandatory fields (e.g., As on Date, Actuals, Aging), the system currently shows an incorrect error message:

"Error in saving information to the database."

This message is misleading and does not guide the user to resolve the issue.

Expected Behavior:
The system should display a clear and user-friendly validation message, such as:

“Please enter As on Date.”

“Actuals are required.”

“Aging is mandatory.”

Steps to Reproduce:

Go to the metric submission screen.

Select a metric.

Leave mandatory fields (e.g., As on Date) empty.

Click Save as Draft or Submit as Final.

Actual Result:
Error message displayed: "Error in saving information to the database."

Expected Result:
Specific validation message indicating which mandatory field(s) are missing.

Impact:

Users are confused by the technical error message.

They are unable to identify which mandatory field is missing.

Leads to failed submissions and poor user experience.

Priority: High (affects core functionality and usability).
