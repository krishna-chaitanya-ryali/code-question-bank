Summary: Code Changes & Deployment for Master Metric ID Alignment

Description:
As part of the recently completed backend change (CRT ID: [Insert CRT ID]), we successfully updated MASTER_METRIC_ID in RAP_METRICS_DETAILS.
Now, corresponding code changes are required to ensure:

1. The application fetches and displays MASTER_METRIC_ID correctly across all impacted modules.


2. Validation logic aligns with the updated data structure (including METRICS_DISPLAY handling from RAP_METRICS_PACK_MAPPING).


3. Any redundant or duplicate metric handling logic is cleaned up.



Scope:

Update DAO/Repository layers to ensure correct retrieval of metrics.

Modify service/business logic to handle updated MASTER_METRIC_ID mappings.

Update UI/API layer if impacted by the new MASTER_METRIC_ID references.

Add/Update unit and integration tests for impacted components.


Deployment Plan:

1. Code changes will be developed in UAT branch.


2. Deployment to UAT environment for testing.


3. Post successful UAT sign-off, deploy to PROD during the next approved release window.



Acceptance Criteria:

All impacted modules fetch and display metrics correctly using the updated MASTER_METRIC_ID.

No functional or regression issues in UAT.

All test cases pass successfully.
