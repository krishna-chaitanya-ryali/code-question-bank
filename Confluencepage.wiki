Subject: Request for UAT Sign-off â€“ Code Fixes for Master Metric Updates

Hi Sandeep / Bishmai,

Good afternoon.

As part of the recent activity, the code fixes have been completed and deployed in the UAT environment. I have tested the changes, and everything is working as expected.

I request you to kindly validate the changes from your side and provide your UAT sign-off so that we can proceed with the production deployment.

Thanks & Regards,
Krishna
