Short Description

CR – Fixes for User Access (Dual PSID), Data Correction (Captured Month), and Missing Metrics in RAP Application

Description

This CR is raised to address multiple production issues in the RAP application:

User unable to access application due to dual PSID conflict → requires DP table update.

User mistakenly captured month with incorrect cell type → requires manual SQL correction.

Certain metrics missing in production → requires investigation and data fix.

These fixes will be executed in the production environment to restore functionality and data accuracy.

Planning – Why is this change being done?

To resolve a critical user access issue (dual PSID).

To correct wrongly captured user data in production.

To restore missing metrics required for reporting and business workflows.

Without these fixes, users are blocked, and reporting accuracy is impacted.

Implementation Plan

Generate password via TPAM and log in to the respective production DB server.

Execute the following steps:

Update user ID mapping in DP table (dual PSID fix).

Apply SQL update for correcting captured month cell type.

Investigate and reinsert/restore missing metrics as required.

Validate changes by querying the DB to ensure updates are correctly applied.

Confirm application functionality with end users (business testers).

Customer / Business Impact During Implementation

No downtime expected, but users may experience minor delays while fixes are applied.

Business users will not be able to see corrections until DB scripts are fully executed.

User access will be restored immediately after DP update.

Technical Impact During Implementation

Direct changes to the production database.

Requires TPAM session and execution of approved SQL scripts.

No impact on system availability, as changes are data-level only.

Backout Plan

Revert database changes using rollback scripts prepared in advance.

If rollback is not feasible, restore production data from latest backup snapshot (DBA support required).

Disable user access temporarily if any inconsistencies occur.

Post-Implementation Verification Plan

Verify DP table update → confirm user can log in.

Verify corrected captured month → query DB and validate with user.

Verify missing metrics → confirm metrics are restored and visible in RAP.

Business team to perform functional validation and sign-off.
