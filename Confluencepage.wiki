Jira Ticket: Request for Schema Backup and Server Details

Summary:
Backup required for RAP schemas and confirmation of server details before production deployment.

Description:
As part of the RAP Incremental Dataload release, we are planning major DB changes (timestamp conversion and related updates). Before proceeding, we need DBA support for the following:

1. Schema Backup:

Take a full backup of the below schemas:

GRDR_ADMIN_DEV

GRDR_ADMIN_UAT

GRDR_ADMIN_PROD (before deployment)


Ensure the backup is restorable in case of rollback.



2. Server Details:

Share DB server names, connection strings, and instance details for DEV, UAT, PROD.

Confirm downtime requirements from the DB perspective.




Acceptance Criteria:

Backups are confirmed and stored safely.

DBA shares server details and confirms availability during the release window.


Priority: High (as this is a pre-requisite for PROD release).
