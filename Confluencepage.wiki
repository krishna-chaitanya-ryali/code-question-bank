ðŸ”¹ Change Request Draft (Pipelines Related)

1. Short Description:
Deployment of Incremental Data Load changes through Jenkins pipelines (DR and Production environments).

2. Description:
This CR is raised for executing Jenkins pipelines to deploy the Incremental Data Load changes into Production.

DR pipeline will be executed first for validation.

Production pipeline will be executed after successful DR run.

This activity ensures that all database changes and corresponding application code changes are synchronized and deployed seamlessly.

3. Why is this change being done?
To enable the Incremental Data Load feature in RAP application by deploying updated database structures, timestamp conversions, and code changes that have already been tested in DEV and UAT. The pipelines will ensure controlled, automated, and repeatable deployments to DR and Production environments.

4. Implementation Plan:

Trigger the DR Jenkins pipeline.

Deploy database changes and code to DR environment.

Validate application startup and smoke test key functionalities.

Once DR pipeline is successful, trigger the Production Jenkins pipeline.

Deploy database changes and code to Production environment.

Validate application startup, confirm services are running, and do quick health checks.

Perform sanity testing with business/technical teams.

Close CR after successful deployment and validation.

5. Customer and Business Impact during the Implementation:

During pipeline execution for Production, the RAP application will be unavailable due to required downtime (approx. 6 hours).

Users will not be able to access RAP application until deployment is complete.

6. Technical Impact during the Implementation:

All RAP application services (both Production and DR) will be stopped during deployment.

Database schema changes (timestamp conversions, incremental load structures) will be applied.

Pipelines will deploy new code aligned with database updates.

No impact on other applications outside RAP.

7. Backout Plan:

In case of failure during DR or Production pipeline:

Stop pipeline execution immediately.

Restore DB schema from pre-deployment backup.

Revert application code to previous stable version via Jenkins pipeline rollback option.

Start RAP services and validate rollback completion.

8. Post Implementation Verification Plan:

Verify RAP application services are up and running in Production.

Perform sanity checks on key functionalities (login, metric creation, metric update, data load validation).

Confirm DB schema changes are applied correctly.

Request business team to validate UAT test cases against Production data.

Confirm with developers and business users for final sign-off.
