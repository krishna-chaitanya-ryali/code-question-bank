Subject: Planned Release: Incremental Data Load â€“ Scheduled Downtime on 27th

Dear Team,

This is to inform you that we are planning to release the Incremental Data Load feature on Saturday, 27th [Month].

As part of this deployment:

Major database changes will be implemented.

There will be a planned downtime of approximately 6 hours.

Both Production and DR servers will be stopped during this window.

This downtime is required to ensure smooth migration and successful deployment of the new feature. We kindly request you to plan your activities accordingly.

We will keep you informed once the deployment is completed and systems are back online.

Please reach out if you have any questions or need additional details.

Thanks & Regards,
Krishna Chaitanya
