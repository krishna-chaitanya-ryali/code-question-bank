Understood. The changes in Dev/UAT were done in a hurry last Friday since you wanted them quickly, and we were also handling multiple tasks in parallel. Production, however, is a planned activity — we’ll go step by step and verify all the tables thoroughly, so I don’t think this issue will occur in prod.
