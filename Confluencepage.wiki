1. Short Description

Deployment of RAP Incremental Dataload changes â€“ Timestamp conversion and related DB/application updates.

2. Description

As part of the RAP Incremental Dataload project, we have implemented changes to convert existing date columns (CREAT_DT, UPDT_DT, etc.) from VARCHAR/DATE to TIMESTAMP(6) format across multiple RAP application tables.
This required both database changes and application code updates to ensure consistency and prevent data issues.
Changes have already been tested in DEV and UAT environments with successful sign-off.

3. Why is this change being done?

To standardize date handling across the RAP application.

To avoid inconsistent formats and null values in date columns.

To support incremental data load functionality with accurate timestamps.

To ensure smoother integration with Pack Builder and other dependent applications.

4. Implementation Plan

Stop RAP and Pack Builder application services on PROD and DR servers.

DBA to take schema backup (GRDR_ADMIN_PROD).

Apply database scripts for timestamp conversion and data cleanup.

Deploy updated Python code from GitHub to application servers.

Restart all services.

Perform smoke testing with developers/business to validate.

5. Customer and Business Impact during the implementation

RAP application and Pack Builder will be unavailable during deployment.

Estimated downtime: 6 hours.

No transactions or updates can be performed during this window.

6. Technical Impact during the implementation

DB schema changes (column type conversions to TIMESTAMP).

Data migration/cleanup for inconsistent date formats.

Application services restart required.

Potential integration impact on Pack Builder during downtime.

7. Backout Plan

In case of failure, restore the PROD schema from backup.

Roll back to previous stable version of application code.

Validate rollback with quick smoke tests before reopening access.

8. Post Implementation Verification Plan

Verify schema changes are correctly applied.

Validate RAP application is up and running.

Business team to test key functionalities (create/update metric, onboarding, reporting).

Confirm Pack Builder integration is working fine.

Send final confirmation mail to stakeholders after validation.
