Title:
Enhancement: API to Download Security Reports for All Dashboards (Super Admin Page)

Description:
Currently, in the Normal Admin page, there is an option to download the security report for a specific dashboard. The requirement is to extend this functionality to the Super Admin page, where the Super Admin should be able to download security reports for all dashboards at once in Excel format.

Scope / Requirements:

Create a new API endpoint that:

Fetches security access details for all dashboards.

Compiles the data into a single Excel file (similar format to existing individual dashboard reports).

Returns the file for download.


Ensure existing data validation and access checks are applied.

Reuse or extend existing report generation logic where possible.

Optimize for performance since the data could be large.


Acceptance Criteria:

API returns a downloadable Excel file containing security reports of all dashboards.

Data format matches the existing per-dashboard security report format.

Proper error handling (e.g., no dashboards available, access issues, server errors).

API is secured and accessible only to Super Admin users.


Dependencies:

Existing per-dashboard report generation logic.

Authentication & authorization module.


Testing Considerations:

Validate Excel format and data accuracy.

Test with a large number of dashboards.

Test with zero dashboards (edge case).

Title:
UI Enhancement: Add "Download All Security Reports" Option in Super Admin Page

Description:
Enhance the Super Admin page to allow downloading of all dashboards' security reports in a single click. This is similar to the existing "Security Access Report" option in the Normal Admin page, but it should fetch all dashboards at once.

Scope / Requirements:

Add a new button/link in the Super Admin page under RAP Metric Management â†’ Security Access Report section.

On click, trigger the newly created backend API to generate and download the consolidated security report.

Show a loading spinner/progress indicator while the file is being generated.

Handle error scenarios gracefully (e.g., show a user-friendly error message if download fails).


Acceptance Criteria:

New "Download All Security Reports" option is visible to Super Admins.

Clicking the option triggers file download of the consolidated report.

Proper loading and error messages are displayed.

UI matches existing look and feel of other download options.


Dependencies:

Backend API providing consolidated report.


Testing Considerations:

Verify file downloads correctly and contains accurate data.

Verify error handling (e.g., API failure, network issues).

Verify button is only visible to Super Admins.
