Dear Team,

As part of the Incremental Data Load implementation, we have raised two Change Requests (CRs) scheduled for deployment on Saturday, 27th September 2025, with an expected downtime window of 10:00 AM – 04:00 PM IST (6 hours). We request your review and approval for the same.

CR#12345 – TPAM & DB Activities

Scope:

TPAM login access for DB/application servers

Schema backup (DBA task)

Execution of SQL queries for timestamp conversion and incremental load changes

Stop/start of application services

Impact: Temporary downtime (~6 hours) as services will be stopped during execution.

CR#12346 – Jenkins Pipelines Execution

Scope:

Execution of DR pipeline

Execution of Production pipeline post DR validation

Application testing to validate DB changes with latest code

Impact: No additional downtime beyond CR#12345. This CR is dependent on successful completion of CR#12345.

Business Impact

Users will not be able to access the application during the scheduled downtime window.

Post deployment, the application will resume with Incremental Data Load functionality enabled.

Schedule

Planned Date: 27th September 2025 (Saturday)

Start Time: 10:00 AM IST

End Time: 04:00 PM IST

Duration: 6 Hours

Request:
We kindly request your approval for CR#12345 and CR#12346 to proceed with the planned deployment.
