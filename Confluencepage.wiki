Subject: Request for TPAM/Paraccess on New Evergreening Servers

Hi Sudeep,

Good Afternoon.

Earlier, I used to have root access on both the DBA and application servers for production, and I also completed the required DBA and Linux certifications to support those activities.

As part of the recent evergreening activity, new servers have been added. I am not requesting root access on these new servers (application or database). Instead, I would like to request TPAM/Paraccess for the specific accounts under which our applications are hosted. This will allow me to generate the required passwords and carry out our day-to-day activities smoothly.

Could you please provide the required TPAM/Paraccess for both the application and database servers for the respective accounts associated with our applications?

Your support on this will be very helpful. Please let me know if you need any further details from my side.

Thanks & Regards,
Krishna Chaitanya
