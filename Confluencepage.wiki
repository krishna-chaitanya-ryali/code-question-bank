Subject: Functional Testing Sign-off – ARAP Application Python Migration (3.6 → 3.12.8)

Dear Team,

We have completed functional testing of the ARAP (Risk-Appetite Profile) application post-migration from Python 3.6 to Python 3.12.8. All functionalities have been verified and are working as expected.

Accordingly, we are providing our functional testing sign-off, and the DevOps team may proceed with planning the deployment.

Thanks,
