Hi Sandeep,

The backend and frontend changes for the Security Access Report have been completed and deployed in UAT. We have validated the functionality, including downloading reports with large datasets (1.5 lakh+ records), and everything is working as expected.

Summary of Changes Implemented:

Optimized backend logic to handle large Excel report generation without timeout or memory issues.

Implemented background processing with polling to ensure smooth user experience.

Added file readiness check before download to avoid incomplete/zero-byte files.

Successfully tested report downloads for both All Packs and Selected Packs scenarios.


We are planning to release this to Production on 18th September.
Requesting your UAT sign-off to proceed with the release.

Thanks & Regards,
Krishna Chaitanya
