Hi Sandeep,

We have tested the entire functionalities with our tester (Pratik), and everything looks good. From the business side, it would be great if you/your team could perform a high-level testing in the next 3 days.

If you notice anything not working as expected, please let us know so that we can fix it before moving the code.

Thanks!
