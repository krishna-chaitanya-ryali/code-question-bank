Subject: Approval Request for Change Requests – Incremental Data Load Deployment (27th Sept)

To: [Business Approver Name(s)]
CC: [Technical Approver Name(s)], DBA Team, Application Team, Project Team

Dear Team,

As part of the Incremental Data Load implementation, we have raised two Change Requests (CRs) scheduled for deployment on Saturday, 27th September. We request your review and approval for the same:

CR #1 – TPAM & DB Activities

Scope:

TPAM login access for DB/application servers

Schema backup (DBA task)

Execution of SQL queries for timestamp conversion and incremental load changes

Stop/start of application services

Impact: Temporary downtime (~6 hours) as services will be stopped during execution

CR #2 – Jenkins Pipelines Execution

Scope:

Execution of DR pipeline

Execution of Production pipeline post DR validation

Application testing to validate DB changes with latest code

Impact: No additional downtime beyond CR #1. This CR is dependent on successful completion of CR #1.

Business Impact:

Users will not be able to access the application during the scheduled downtime window.

Once deployment completes, application will resume with the new incremental data load functionality enabled.

Request:
We kindly request your approval for both CRs to proceed with the planned deployment on 27th September (Saturday).

Please confirm your approval at the earliest so that we can coordinate with the DBA and infrastructure teams accordingly.
