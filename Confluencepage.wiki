Short Description:

Update L1 Taxonomy dropdown by adding new risk type fields in the RAP_APPLICABLE_RISK_TYPE table.

Why is this change being done?

Users have requested inclusion of additional risk categories in the L1 Taxonomy dropdown to align with the latest business classification and reporting needs.

Implementation Plan:

Generate a PAM request and obtain DB access credentials.

Log in to the database server using the PAM-provided credentials.

Insert the following new fields into the RAP_APPLICABLE_RISK_TYPE table:

Regulatory Risk

Reporting Risk

Conduct Risk

Climate Risk

Artificial Intelligence Risk

Digital Assets and Currency Risks

Validate that the new values appear correctly in the front-end dropdown.

Customer / Business Impact During Implementation:

No customer or business impact expected. The change is limited to backend data configuration and will not affect ongoing operations.

Technical Impact During Implementation:

Minimal. Only database table update; no code or service restart required. UI automatically reflects updated taxonomy fields.

Backward Plan:

If any issue occurs, remove the newly added entries from the RAP_APPLICABLE_RISK_TYPE table to restore the previous state.

Post-Implementation Verification:

Validate that all six new taxonomy fields appear correctly in the L1 dropdown.

Cross-check data integrity in the RAP_APPLICABLE_RISK_TYPE table.

Confirm successful display and selection on the UI in UAT/Prod.
