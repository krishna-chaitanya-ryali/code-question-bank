Subject: Prioritization of Production Issues

Hi Team,

We would like to bring clarity on handling production issues. Not all issues can be categorized or prioritized in the same way. Broadly, there are two types:

System/Functional Issues (Bugs):

These are genuine issues where functionality is impacted for users (e.g., inability to save or update a metric).

Such issues will be treated with high priority and resolved on priority basis.

User Errors / Data Correction Requests:

These occur when incorrect data is entered/submitted by users, and later requests are made to reopen or modify already captured data.

These requests are not categorized as urgent production issues, since they are not caused by application defects. They will be planned and addressed in alignment with ongoing development work.

Given the parallel workload on development and production support, we cannot treat both categories with the same urgency. Critical bugs will always remain our top priority, while data correction requests will be taken up in a planned manner.

We kindly request your cooperation in distinguishing between these types of issues and aligning expectations accordingly.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]
