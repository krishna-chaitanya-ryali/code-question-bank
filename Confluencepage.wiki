Hi Team,

RAP UAT has been pointed to the incremental data load changes. For the next 3 days, business and QA teams will be testing the current RAP functionality with these changes.

Please note: other functionalities not dependent on incremental data load may not work as expected during this period. Our focus will be only on incremental data load testing until the next release.
