Subject: Prioritization of Production Issues & User Requests

Hi Team,

I would like to clarify how we handle production issues, as not all issues can be treated with the same urgency.

1. System / Functional Issues (Bugs)

These are genuine issues where functionality or performance is impacted for users (e.g., inability to save or update a metric).

Such issues will be treated with highest priority and addressed immediately.

2. User Errors / Data Correction Requests

These arise when users have entered or submitted incorrect data (for example, entering actual values and later requesting a change in text type or data).

Handling these requires preparing manual queries, raising and approving a CR, and following the full deployment cycle. With over 100+ packs and frequent requests, this consumes significant time and effort.

These requests cannot be treated as urgent production issues, as they do not affect system functionality. They will be taken up as low priority and planned accordingly, depending on bandwidth.

3. Formula / Customization Support

Requests for formula corrections or customizations are also not production defects. While we will provide support, it can only be taken up when the team has availability, since our primary focus remains on core development and critical issues.

ðŸ‘‰ We kindly request everyoneâ€™s cooperation in prioritizing issues correctly. With limited resources balancing both development and production, it is not possible to address every user mistake or customization request on urgent basis. Critical bugs will always remain our top focus, while user data corrections and non-technical requests will be handled as per availability.

Thanks for your understanding and support.

Regards,
[Your Name]
