Subject: Request for Business Validation in UAT â€“ RAP Incremental Dataload

Hi Team,

As informed earlier, as part of the Incremental Dataload project, we have carried out the following major changes:

Converted all date/time columns (e.g., CREAT_DT, UPDT_DT, etc.) from VARCHAR/DATE to TIMESTAMP(6) format for consistency and accuracy.

Updated the respective Python application code and database objects to align with this datatype change.

Handled data clean-up and backfilling for inconsistent records (ensuring no null/invalid values).

Ensured that common tables used by both RAP and Pack Builder are updated, with respective teams informed to align their code.


These changes are now deployed in the UAT environment (both code and DB).

We kindly request the Business team to validate all impacted functionalities in RAP on UAT and provide your sign-off. This will help us proceed smoothly with the production deployment.

Please let us know if you face any issues during testing.

Thanks & Regards,
Krishna
