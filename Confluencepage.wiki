Jira Ticket: DBA Support for Production Deployment â€“ Datetime Migration

Summary:
Requesting DBA assistance for executing SQL scripts related to datetime conversion and timestamp migration during the PROD deployment scheduled on Saturday, 20th [Month, Year].

Description:
As part of our initiative to standardize datetime handling across the application, we have performed the following in Dev and UAT:

Database changes (Dev & UAT completed):

Added new timestamp columns (*_TMP) for datetime migration.

Backfilled data by converting multiple datetime string formats into proper TIMESTAMP.

Handled exceptions for inconsistent formats (e.g., DD-MON-YY, DD-MM-YYYY HH24:MI:SS, YYYYMMDD).

Updated relevant business tables (e.g., MAP_RAP_USER_ROLE, MEET_INSTC, RAP_METRICS_DETAILS, etc.).

Implemented default CREAT_DT and UPDT_DT triggers to avoid null values.

Verified data consistency and completed code changes in UAT.

Code changes (UAT completed):

Updated queries and logic to use new timestamp columns.

Validated all functionalities successfully in UAT.

Production Deployment Requirement:
On 20th, we need DBA support to:

Execute all approved SQL migration scripts on PROD.

Validate data migration for key tables.

Ensure triggers for CREAT_DT and UPDT_DT are created correctly in PROD.

Support the application team during smoke testing post-deployment.

Action Required from DBA:

Confirm availability on Saturday, 20th [Month, Year] for deployment window.

Execute the provided SQL scripts in sequence (scripts will be shared prior to release).

Validate execution logs and confirm successful run.

Provide rollback support in case of any issues.

Deployment Date/Time:
