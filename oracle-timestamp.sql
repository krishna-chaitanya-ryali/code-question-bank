Subject: Request to Validate Missing MASTER_METRIC_ID Fixes in RAP Tables

Hi Shubhadip,

We've completed the end-to-end cleanup for the missing MASTER_METRIC_ID mappings in the RAP tables. This includes both:

New inserts into RAP_MASTER_METRIC_DETAILS, and

Updates to RAP_METRICS_DETAILS.MASTER_METRIC_ID (including corrections where incorrect mappings existed earlier).

üìå This also covers cases where metric names had slight variations (e.g., '30+ days delinquency' not matching exactly across tables).

üìé Kindly test and validate the updated data in UAT.

üìù Detailed documentation with all queries and logic is available here:
üëâ Confluence Page ‚Äì Risk Type and Master Metric Cleanup

üìÖ Note: I will be on leave on the 6th and 7th of August, so please reach out before or after for any clarifications.

Thanks,
Chaitanya

Subject: Request to Test Master Metric ID Updates for Missing Metrics

Hi Shubhadip,

We have completed the backfill of MASTER_METRIC_IDs for all metrics in the RAP_METRICS_DETAILS table, including those that were previously missed due to mismatch in METRICS_DISP and METRICS_DISPLAY values.

All new metric names not found in RAP_MASTER_METRIC_DETAILS have now been inserted appropriately, and their IDs have been mapped back to the RAP_METRICS_DETAILS table.

‚úÖ Request:
Please test and validate if all required metrics are now mapped with a valid MASTER_METRIC_ID, especially the ones that were missing earlier (e.g., 30+ days delinquency, Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), etc).

üîó You can find the detailed update steps and scripts in the following Confluence page:
RAP - Master Metric ID Mapping Fixes

Let us know if you observe any discrepancies.

Thanks,
Krishna Chaitanya

This document outlines the updated SQL scripts and logic used to:

Identify and insert missing master metrics

Update the MASTER_METRIC_ID in RAP_METRICS_DETAILS

Correct earlier misassignments

üßæ Updated SQL Documentation (Top to Bottom)
üîπ 1. Identify Missing Master Metric Entries
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE METRIC_MISSING_INSERT AS
SELECT DISTINCT d.METRICS_DISPLAY, r.RISK_TYPE_ID
FROM RAP_METRICS_DETAILS d
JOIN RAP_METRICS_PACK_MAPPING p ON d.RAP_METRICS_MAPPING_ID = p.RAP_METRICS_MAPPING_ID
JOIN RAP r ON d.RAP_ID = r.RAP_ID
LEFT JOIN RAP_MASTER_METRIC_DETAILS m 
  ON m.MASTER_METRIC_NAME = d.METRICS_DISPLAY AND m.RISK_TYPE_ID = r.RISK_TYPE_ID
WHERE TRIM(p.METRICS_DISP) <> TRIM(d.METRICS_DISPLAY)
  AND m.MASTER_METRIC_ID IS NULL;
üîπ 2. Insert Missing Metrics (ID is auto-generated)
sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO RAP_MASTER_METRIC_DETAILS (MASTER_METRIC_NAME, RISK_TYPE_ID)
SELECT DISTINCT METRICS_DISPLAY, RISK_TYPE_ID
FROM METRIC_MISSING_INSERT;
üîπ 3. Update RAP_METRICS_DETAILS with Correct MASTER_METRIC_ID
sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE RAP_METRICS_DETAILS d
SET MASTER_METRIC_ID = (
    SELECT m.MASTER_METRIC_ID
    FROM RAP_MASTER_METRIC_DETAILS m
    JOIN RAP r ON r.RAP_ID = d.RAP_ID
    WHERE m.MASTER_METRIC_NAME = d.METRICS_DISPLAY
      AND m.RISK_TYPE_ID = r.RISK_TYPE_ID
)
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM RAP_MASTER_METRIC_DETAILS m
    JOIN RAP r ON r.RAP_ID = d.RAP_ID
    WHERE m.MASTER_METRIC_NAME = d.METRICS_DISPLAY
      AND m.RISK_TYPE_ID = r.RISK_TYPE_ID
);
üîπ 4. Final Verification Query

Edit
SELECT *
FROM RAP_METRICS_DETAILS
