JIRA Ticket 1: Implement Scheduler for User Recertification Updates

Title:
Implement Scheduler to Update User Access Status Based on Line Manager Approval

Type: Story / Task

Description:
As part of the user recertification process for RAP and PackBuilder applications, we need to automate the update of user access statuses based on line manager approvals.

Currently, approvals are manually processed and updated in the USER_TAB table. The goal is to create a scheduler job that periodically checks for approved/rejected users and updates their access accordingly.

Scope:

Develop a scheduler that runs at predefined intervals (e.g., daily at midnight).

Fetch user approval data from the recertification approval table.

Update access flags (RAP_ACCESS_FLAG, PACKBUILDER_ACCESS_FLAG) in the USER_TAB table based on approval outcome.

Maintain audit trail with timestamps and processed status.

Add basic logging for success/failure tracking.


Acceptance Criteria:

âœ… Scheduler runs automatically at configured interval.

âœ… Approved users are updated with the correct access flags.

âœ… Logs are generated for each run with a summary of total users processed.

âœ… Manual trigger option available for testing or on-demand runs.


Sprint:
Target for Sprint XX (2-week) completion.

Dependencies:

Availability of approval data in the recertification table.

Confirmation of database credentials for scheduler job execution.

ðŸ§© JIRA Ticket 2: PackBuilder User Recertification Workflow Integration

Title:
Integrate PackBuilder User Recertification Logic with Scheduler and Access Management

Type: Story / Task

Description:
Enhance the existing user recertification process for the PackBuilder application to ensure that access rights are aligned with the approved status from line managers.

Once the line manager responds to the recertification request (Approve/Reject), the scheduler should pick up these updates and synchronize them with the corresponding user records.

Scope:

Implement logic to read user recertification approvals for PackBuilder.

Map approved users to correct USER_TAB entries.

Update the relevant fields such as:

PACKBUILDER_ACCESS_FLAG

LAST_REVIEWED_DATE

APPROVED_BY (Line Manager PSID)


Ensure rejected usersâ€™ access is revoked immediately during the next scheduler run.

Validate that email notifications or audit entries are generated after updates.


Acceptance Criteria:

âœ… Approved users retain PackBuilder access.

âœ… Rejected users lose PackBuilder access within one scheduler cycle.

âœ… Scheduler logs show PackBuilder user sync results clearly.

âœ… QA validation confirms updates are reflected correctly in DB.


Sprint:
To be completed within the same 2-week sprint as the scheduler development.

Dependencies:

Completion of Scheduler (Ticket 1).

Approval table structure and field mappings confirmed.
