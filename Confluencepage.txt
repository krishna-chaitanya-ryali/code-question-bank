Subject: Issue: Monthly Risk Culture File Not Transferring to Destination Server

Hi Team,

Good afternoon.

We have identified an issue with the monthly file transfer process from the RAP Production Server to the Risk Culture Production Server.

As per the standard schedule, the file is generated and downloaded on our RAP Production server on the 1st of every month at 10:00 AM. This process has been working consistently for the past two years.
However, this month, while the file was successfully downloaded on our server, it did not get transferred to the Risk Culture server.

I attempted to run the transfer manually as well, but the connection is prompting for a password, which indicates a possible trust / SSH key issue between the two servers.
This trust was earlier configured and working, so it appears to have been removed or broken in the recent past.

I am attaching the screenshot of the error message for reference.

Request:
Kindly check the server-level trust configuration between:

Source: RAP Production Server

Destination: Risk Culture Production Server
and help re-establish the required access so that the automated monthly transfer can proceed as expected.

Please let me know if any additional details or logs are required.

Thanks & Regards,
R. Krishna Chaitanya

Summary:

Monthly Risk Culture file transfer failing from RAP Prod to Risk Culture Prod server

Description:

We are facing an issue with the monthly file transfer from the RAP Production server to the Risk Culture Production server.

This job runs on the 1st of every month at 10:00 AM and has been working consistently for the past ~2 years.
However, for the current month:

The file is successfully generated and downloaded on the RAP Production server.

The file is not transferred to the Risk Culture Production server.

When attempting to transfer the file manually, the connection prompts for a password, indicating a possible SSH trust / key-based authentication issue between the two servers.

This trust was previously configured and working, so it may have been broken or removed recently.

Expected Behavior:

The file should be transferred automatically from RAP Prod to Risk Culture Prod without password prompts, using existing SSH trust.

Actual Behavior:

File transfer fails and prompts for password when attempted manually.

Impact:

Monthly Risk Culture data is not delivered to the downstream system.

Manual intervention required until trust is restored.

Action Requested:

Verify SSH trust / key-based authentication between:

Source: RAP Production Server

Destination: Risk Culture Production Server

Re-establish trust if missing.

Validate file transfer post-fix.
