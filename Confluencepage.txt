Subject: Follow-up on Action Items â€“ Global RAP Metric Automation

Hi Srikaran,

As discussed, I have provided the required background details, data inputs, and infrastructure information to help with the preparation of the data model and approach for the upcoming Architecture Forum scheduled on Friday, 24th November.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarifications from my side.

Kindly ensure to flag any potential delays or dependencies at the earliest, as we have just a couple of days to finalize the initial draft for the review.

Regards,
R. Krishna Chaitanya
