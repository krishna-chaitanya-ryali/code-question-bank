Subject: Reminder: Validate RAP Onboarding Flow During Enhancements

Hi Team,

As we continue to roll out new enhancements and improvements in the RAP application, I wanted to share a quick reminder regarding our development and testing process.

With every enhancement—whether it’s a change to access logic, dashboard components, or core functionalities—it’s important that we also validate the end-to-end RAP onboarding process.
Since onboarding is tightly integrated with multiple modules, even small improvements can sometimes influence the flow in unexpected ways.

To avoid last-minute issues when an onboarding request arrives, let’s ensure that:

Every new feature or update includes a basic onboarding sanity check.

Any changes affecting roles, access mappings, or user flow are cross-verified with onboarding.

Potential impacts are flagged early so we can address them proactively.

This helps us maintain a stable and reliable onboarding experience while continuing to deliver enhancements at speed.

Thanks for your support and cooperation.
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Regards,
