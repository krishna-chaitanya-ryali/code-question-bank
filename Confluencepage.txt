If you have any ongoing tickets in the current sprint that are partially completed (for example, development is half done or pending UAT), please close the current ticket with the completed details and create a new ticket for the remaining work.

This will help us maintain proper sprint tracking and ensure the pending tasks are carried forward cleanly to the next sprint without mixing old and new progress.
