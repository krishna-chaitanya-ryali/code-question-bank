Short Description

Execution of application pipelines in DR and Production environments to enable ERR User Recertification Phase-1 dry run.

Description

This change request is raised to execute application deployment pipelines in DR and Production environments to support the ERR User Recertification Phase-1 (Scope 2025) dry run.

The deployment includes controlled application logic changes required for:

Triggering recertification workflows

Sending reminder notifications

Supporting manual and scheduled execution

Enabling dry-run configuration for selected users only

No functional changes impacting general users will be executed as part of this change.

Why is this Change Being Done?

This change is required to:

Deploy approved application code supporting ERR User Recertification Phase-1.

Enable a production dry run for a limited set of users and line managers.

Validate scheduler execution, notification flow, and access handling in production.

Ensure readiness before full-scale recertification rollout.

Implementation Plan

Confirm database change CR is completed successfully.

Execute DR application pipeline.

Perform basic smoke testing in DR.

Execute Production application pipeline.

Verify application services are up and running.

Enable dry-run configuration (restricted to identified users).

Monitor logs and application health post-deployment.

Customer and Business Impact

No customer impact.

Business impact is minimal and controlled.

No change to actual user access during the dry run.

Changes are restricted to selected test users only.

Technical Impact During Implementation

Application services may be restarted during deployment.

No expected downtime or user-facing disruption.

Deployment is backward compatible and configuration-driven.

Backup Plan

Existing application version will remain available for rollback.

Configuration backups will be retained.

No data modification performed by the pipeline execution itself.

Rollback Plan

In case of issues:

Roll back to the previous stable application version.

Disable dry-run configuration flags.

Stop scheduler jobs if required.

Post-Implementation Verification Plan

Verify:

Application is accessible post-deployment.

Scheduler jobs are running as expected.

Manual trigger functionality works correctly.

Logs show successful execution with no errors.

Obtain confirmation from business and QA teams after dry run.
