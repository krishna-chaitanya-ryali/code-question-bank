Got it, Chaitanya 👍 — I fully understand the scenario now:

This is a new feature / new job (not yet in Prod)

Already tested in Dev/UAT

We want a simple, short JIRA mainly for:

Fresh deployment to Prod

Linux team support for placing script in correct directory (if needed)

Optional execution support

No deep technical internals, no Python packaging explanation

Here is a clean, short, and production-friendly JIRA ticket:

📝 JIRA Title

Deploy New Python Job to Update Line Manager Details in Production

📌 Description

A new Python job has been developed and tested in non-production environments (DEV/UAT) to update Line Manager details in application tables using existing RAP application configuration.

This job is not yet deployed to Production.
We are planning a fresh deployment of this job into Production.

Requesting Linux team support to place the script in the agreed location and assist with execution if required.

📂 Script Location (Target in Prod)
/opt/HSBC/rap/update-line-manager-details/


(Application team will share the script package or Git repository path separately.)

🛠 Linux Team Request

Create the above directory if it does not exist.

Place the provided script folder under:

/opt/HSBC/rap/


If required, assist in executing the script using the command shared by application team.

🛡 DBA Pre-Deployment Activity

Take backup of impacted application tables before running the job.

✅ Expected Outcome

Job is available in Production under RAP directory.

Script can be executed successfully.

Line Manager details get updated as per logic already validated in DEV/UAT.

🔍 Impact

Low – New job deployment only.
No impact to existing production jobs.

Database safety ensured via backup

🔍 Impact

Low risk – only adds empty __init__.py files and adjusts execution method.
No application logic changes.
DB backup provides rollback safety.

🧪 Validation Steps

Linux team runs:

cd /opt/HSBC
python -m rap.update-line-manager-details.mod_view


Confirm job starts without import errors.

Verify logs show successful processing.

DBA confirms backup completion.

JIRA Ticket – Production Release

Summary
Production Release – User Recertification Enhancements & Line Manager Details Population

Issue Type
Change / Release

Description
We are planning a production release to deploy enhancements related to User Recertification and Line Manager (LM) details population. The release includes database schema changes, application code updates for populating and enriching line manager details using Active Directory, and deployment of validated code through DR and PROD pipelines.

This release ensures accurate line manager mapping, mail ID enrichment, and supports upcoming user recertification functionality.

Scope of Release

Database schema changes for user recertification and LM related fields

Application code changes for LM population using LDAP

Static code updates already validated in UAT

DR and PROD pipeline execution

Environments
UAT → DR → PROD

Planned Release Date
Tuesday (mention date)

Risk Level
Low

Rollback Plan

Revert DB schema changes (drop added columns if required)

Roll back application code to previous stable version

Stop scheduler jobs if enabled

Validation / Testing

UAT functional testing completed

LM details verified in USER_TAB

No regression observed

Dependencies

Approved Change Requests (CRs)

Pipeline availability

✅ CR-1 : DB Changes + Application Static Code

Title
Implement DB Schema Changes and Static Code Updates for Line Manager Population & User Recertification

Reason for Change
To support user recertification and ensure accurate line manager details (ID, name, mail) are populated and maintained in the application using Active Directory lookups.

Description
This change introduces new database columns and static application code updates to populate and maintain line manager details in USER_TAB. The changes are required for upcoming user recertification functionality and reporting.

List of Changes

Database

Add new columns in USER_TAB (LM_ID, LM_NAME, LM_MAIL) (as applicable)

Any additional recertification related columns

Application

Add new LM population job

LDAP lookup integration

Bulk update logic

Logging improvements

Implementation Plan

Apply DB DDL scripts

Deploy updated application code

Restart application services

Validate data population

Backout Plan

Revert DB DDL

Rollback code deployment

Restart services

Verification Steps

Verify columns exist

Run LM populate job

Validate sample users

Check logs

Business Impact
Ensures correct line manager mapping and enables user recertification process.

Customer Impact
None (backend change)

Risk
Low

✅ CR-2 : DR & PROD Pipeline Execution

Title
Execute DR and PROD Pipelines for User Recertification and LM Population Enhancements

Reason for Change
To deploy tested code and DB changes into DR and PROD environments.

Description
Run deployment pipelines for DR and PROD to release the new enhancements related to LM population and user recertification.

Components Impacted

CI/CD pipelines

Application servers

Implementation Plan

Trigger DR pipeline

Perform smoke testing

Trigger PROD pipeline

Post deployment verification

Backout Plan

Rollback pipeline to previous artifact

Restart services

Verification Steps

Application up and running

Logs show no errors

Sample LM data validated

Business Impact
Supports compliance and access governance.

Customer Impact
None

Risk
Low
