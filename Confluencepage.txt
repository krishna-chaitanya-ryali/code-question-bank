Subject: Discussion on Access Request Enhancement & Reverse Error Logic – 3 PM Zoom Call

Hi Sandeep,

Hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to have a quick discussion regarding the Access Request Enhancement and the Reverse Error Logic tasks. Since both items are quite time-consuming and require coordination between the team members, I believe it would be good to align on the timelines and priorities before proceeding further.

I’ve scheduled a Zoom call today at 3:00 PM to go over the current status, team bandwidth, and proposed timelines for both tasks.

Meeting Details:
🕒 Time: 3:00 PM today
📍 Mode: Zoom (link to be shared shortly)
🗒️ Agenda: Task status, dependencies, and timeline alignment

Looking forward to your participation in the discussion.

Best regards,
R Krishna Chaitanya
