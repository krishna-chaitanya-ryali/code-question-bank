Subject: Issue: Monthly Risk Culture File Not Transferring to Destination Server

Hi Team,

Good afternoon.

We have identified an issue with the monthly file transfer process from the RAP Production Server to the Risk Culture Production Server.

As per the standard schedule, the file is generated and downloaded on our RAP Production server on the 1st of every month at 10:00 AM. This process has been working consistently for the past two years.
However, this month, while the file was successfully downloaded on our server, it did not get transferred to the Risk Culture server.

I attempted to run the transfer manually as well, but the connection is prompting for a password, which indicates a possible trust / SSH key issue between the two servers.
This trust was earlier configured and working, so it appears to have been removed or broken in the recent past.

I am attaching the screenshot of the error message for reference.

Request:
Kindly check the server-level trust configuration between:

Source: RAP Production Server

Destination: Risk Culture Production Server
and help re-establish the required access so that the automated monthly transfer can proceed as expected.

Please let me know if any additional details or logs are required.

Thanks & Regards,
R. Krishna Chaitanya
