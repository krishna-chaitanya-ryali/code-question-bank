Hi Sandeep,

Good evening.

As discussed earlier today, we are planning to perform a production dry run for the User Recertification enhancements on the 27th of this week. Ahead of raising the change requests and finalizing the deployment plan, we would need a few inputs from your side to proceed further.

Could you please help us with the following details:

1. Production Users for Dry Run
   
   - List of production user(s) whose access needs to be revoked as part of the dry run.
   - Corresponding Line Manager details for each of those users.

2. Reminder Email Schedule (ERR Team – Ashok)
   
   - When should the first reminder email be triggered?
   - Time gap between first & second reminder, and second & third reminder.

3. Scheduler Frequency for LM Actions
   
   - Preferred frequency for scheduler execution to process Line Manager responses (e.g., hourly, every 30 minutes, etc.).

4. Final System Revoke Date & Time
   
   - Date and time when the final system revoke should be executed after completion of LM testing.

We would ideally need the above details by tomorrow so that we can configure the database changes and application settings at least one day prior to the planned deployment.

Please let us know if you need any additional information from our side.

Thanks & Regards,
R Krishna Chaitanya
