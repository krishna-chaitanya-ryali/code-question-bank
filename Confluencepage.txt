Subject: Timezone issue in RECERT_RESPONSE timestamp causing scheduler mismatch
Hi Team,
We identified a timezone-related issue with timestamps being inserted into the UK Oracle database from the HK application layer.
Currently, timestamps such as:
ACCESS_REVOKE_DATE_BY_LINEMANAGER
CREAT_DT / UPDT_DT
are inserted using SYSTIMESTAMP / CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, which stores the application server’s local timezone (HK).
Our scheduler and database server run in UK timezone, so when comparisons are done using SYSDATE, records appear as “future dated” and revocation logic is skipped.
Recommended Fix (Standard Practice):
Please store all timestamps in UTC using:
Copy code
Sql
SYS_EXTRACT_UTC(SYSTIMESTAMP)
or
Copy code
Sql
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'
Example:
Copy code
Sql
ACCESS_REVOKE_DATE_BY_LINEMANAGER = SYS_EXTRACT_UTC(SYSTIMESTAMP)
This will ensure consistent behavior across regions and avoid date mismatch issues.
Let us know once this change is implemented so we can validate end-to-end.
Thanks.
