Change Request – Production Dry Run (User Recertification Enhancements)
Short Description

Production Dry Run – Deploy User Recertification Enhancements & Line Manager Population Logic via Jenkins Pipeline

Description

This change request is to deploy the latest backend enhancements related to User Recertification and Line Manager (LM) details population into the Production environment for a controlled dry run.

The changes include:

Backend logic to populate and update Line Manager ID, Name, and Mail ID in USER_TAB using Active Directory.

Backend logic to support user recertification workflow, including system revoke and UI checkbox indication.

Configuration updates and deployment through Jenkins pipelines.

Database backup prior to deployment.

Purpose of Change / Why is this Change Required?

To enable a controlled production dry run of the User Recertification feature and ensure accurate Line Manager information is available in the system. This will support access governance, compliance requirements, and validation of recertification behavior before full-scale rollout.

Scope of Change

Application backend code deployment via Jenkins pipeline

Scheduler-related configuration (as per approved logic)

No UI breaking changes

No data migration (only data population/updates)

Implementation Plan

Obtain DBA confirmation and perform full database backup.

Trigger Jenkins pipeline for production deployment.

Deploy updated backend code.

Restart application services (if required).

Validate application health.

Execute production dry run for selected users and line managers.

Backout / Rollback Plan

Rollback application code using previous stable Jenkins artifact.

Restart application services.

Restore database from backup if required.

Post-Implementation Verification Plan

Verify application is up and accessible.

Verify Line Manager details are populated in USER_TAB.

Verify user recertification checkbox visibility.

Validate system revoke and LM revoke functionality for test users.

Check logs for errors.

Business Impact

Positive impact – Enables compliance-driven user recertification and access governance.

No negative business impact expected.

Customer Impact

None. Changes are backend-only and executed as controlled dry run.

Technical Impact

Backend services will be restarted (if required).

Jenkins pipeline execution.

No downtime expected.

Jira Ticket – Description

Title
User Recertification – Production Dry Run Preparation & Execution

Description
This ticket tracks the activities required to perform a controlled production dry run of the User Recertification feature. The objective of this dry run is to validate end-to-end user recertification flow, including line manager-driven revoke, system revoke, and UI indicator behavior, using a limited set of production users.

The scope includes backend enhancements, scheduler configuration, database readiness, and coordination with business stakeholders for test user and line manager inputs.

Key features covered in this dry run:

Line Manager details (ID, Name, Mail) population in USER_TAB using AD integration.

Line Manager revoke processing via scheduler.

System revoke processing after final reminder conditions.

UI checkbox to indicate completion of user recertification for a year.

Controlled execution on a small set of production users.

This dry run will help confirm stability and correctness before enabling the solution for wider production usage.

✅ Jira Comments / Progress Update

Progress Update – [Date]

Completed backend development for User Recertification logic.

Implemented Line Manager details population (LM ID, LM Name, LM Mail) in USER_TAB using AD lookup with dual resolution (Employee ID / PSID).

Implemented scheduler jobs:

Line Manager revoke job (hourly).

System revoke job (once per day – configurable).

Implemented logic to update SYSTEM_REVOKE_DONE_IND when system revoke completes.

Implemented UI checkbox logic driven from database flag to indicate recertification completion.

Verified functionality in UAT with manual and scheduler-based testing.
