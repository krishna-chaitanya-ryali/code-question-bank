Hi Ipsita,

I wanted to share some honest feedback and seek clarity regarding my current situation.

I was surprised to receive a "Needs Improvement" rating, especially given my continuous contributions over the past several years on the RAP project, including development, production support, critical fixes, and ensuring platform stability. I have been consistently working with a strong sense of ownership and responsibility, and I would like to understand the specific areas where my performance is considered below expectations.

At the same time, I would also like to share that I have been working on the same project since around 2020/2021, and with the recent feedback and lack of visible growth or recognition, I am feeling increasingly demotivated.

Given this, I would like to request a discussion on either:

* Re-evaluating my performance based on my actual contributions, and/or
* Exploring a possible release or role change to a different engagement where I can continue to add value with better alignment and growth.

I am committed to delivering quality work, but I also need clarity on expectations, fair evaluation, and a sustainable path forward.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Regards,
R Krishna Chaitanya
