We checked and the user is still showing with HBU UK pack access in the database. We do not see any recent removal request raised via the UI.
Could you please confirm how the user was removed from RAPDB? Was a request submitted through the application to remove the user or the pack access?
Please note that direct DB removal is not supported — access must be removed through the UI for it to reflect correctly in the security report.
Kindly confirm so we can proceed further.
