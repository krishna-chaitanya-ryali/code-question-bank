Additional Points

Each developer should take up at least one production request parallel to current development tasks every week.

Based on your bandwidth and issue priority (blocker / critical / normal), you may take up more.

Each developer should also raise at least one Change Request (CR) per week.

As a team, this will help us consistently achieve a minimum of 3 CRs per week and ensure smooth production support alongside ongoing development.


👏 Great work team! Let’s continue this momentum and ensure both development and production requests are balanced effectively.
