def process_lm_recertification():
    """
    Line Manager–driven user recertification job.

    This scheduler runs periodically (hourly) to process user access
    revocation decisions made by Line Managers.

    Workflow:
    1. Fetch records from RECREATE_RESPONSE where access is marked as REVOKE.
    2. Validate revoke date (ACCESS_REVOKED_DATE_BY_LINE_MANAGER).
    3. If revoke date is reached or passed:
       - Deactivate metric-level access for the user.
       - Deactivate user–RMM role mapping.
       - Mark the RECREATE_RESPONSE record as processed.
    4. Skip records scheduled for future revoke dates.

    This function is idempotent and safe to re-run.

def process_system_recertification():
    """
    System-driven user recertification job.

    This scheduler runs once per day to handle users where
    Line Managers have not responded after multiple reminders.

    Workflow:
    1. Identify Line Managers who received 3 reminder emails
       and exceeded the defined waiting period.
    2. Fetch users under those Line Managers from USER_TAB.
    3. For users with no existing RECREATE_RESPONSE entry:
       - Insert a new RECREATE_RESPONSE record with ACCESS_STATUS = 'REVOKE'.
       - Actioned by system (SYSTEM_REVOKED).
    4. Revoke access by:
       - Deactivating metric-level access.
       - Deactivating user–RMM role mapping.

    This job enforces compliance by removing inactive users
    even without explicit Line Manager action.

def revoke_user_access(cursor, user_id, rmm_id):
    """
    Revokes user access for a specific RMM.

    This function performs a soft-revocation (no deletes) by:
    1. Identifying all metric_detail_ids associated with the user
       for the given RMM and current month.
    2. Deactivating all corresponding rows in METRIC_ACCESS.
    3. Deactivating the user–RMM mapping in MAP_RAP_USER_ROLE.

    Parameters:
    - cursor : Active database cursor
    - user_id : User identifier whose access is being revoked
    - rmm_id  : RMM identifier for which access is revoked

    The operation is transactional and safe for repeated execution.

def bulk_update_data(self, sqlQry, param_list):
    """
    Executes bulk DML operations using executemany().

    Supports efficient bulk UPDATE or INSERT operations by
    accepting a list of bind-parameter dictionaries.

    Features:
    - Uses executemany for performance.
    - Commits the transaction after execution.
    - Returns total number of rows affected.
    - Logs requested vs updated row counts for auditing.

    Parameters:
    - sqlQry     : SQL statement with named bind variables
    - param_list : List of dictionaries containing bind values

    Returns:
    - int : Total number of rows affected, or -1 on error

    Parameters:
    - query_key : Key to fetch SQL from QueryString
