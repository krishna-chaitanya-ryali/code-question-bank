Change Request – Database Changes (ERR User Recertification)
Short Description

Database changes to support ERR User Recertification Phase-1 dry run, including line manager data updates and new recertification tables.

Description

This change request is raised to implement required database changes to support the ERR User Recertification Phase-1 (Scope 2025) dry run.

As part of this change:

Line manager details will be inserted/updated for a limited set of identified users.

New database tables and columns required for the recertification process will be created.

A database backup will be taken prior to executing the changes.

These changes are required to enable controlled testing of the recertification workflow without impacting the broader user population.

Why is this Change Being Done?

The change is required to:

Prepare the database for ERR User Recertification Phase-1.

Support a production dry run using a limited number of users and line managers.

Ensure database structures are in place before triggering application-level recertification logic.

Validate end-to-end recertification behavior in a controlled and auditable manner.

Implementation Plan

Take a full database backup before starting the activity.

Create required new tables to support recertification (e.g., recertification response and related tables).

Add required new columns to existing tables (e.g., user table enhancements for line manager data).

Insert/update line manager details for the identified set of users only (dry-run scope).

Validate successful creation of tables, columns, and data updates.

Hand over database readiness confirmation to the application team.

Customer and Business Impact

No direct customer impact.

Business impact is minimal and controlled, limited only to the identified test users.

No changes will be made to actual user access as part of this database change.

Technical Impact During Implementation

Temporary database locks may occur during DDL/DML execution.

No expected downtime for the application.

Changes are isolated and scoped to specific tables and users only.

Backup Plan

A full database backup will be taken prior to implementation.

Backup will be retained until post-implementation verification is completed successfully.

Rollback Plan

In case of any issue:

Restore database from the pre-change backup.

Drop newly created tables/columns if required.

Revert inserted/updated records related to the dry run.

Post-Implementation Verification Plan

Verify:

New tables are created successfully.

New columns exist with correct data types.

Line manager data is correctly populated for the identified users.

Run validation queries to confirm data accuracy.

Obtain confirmation from application team that database changes are successful.
