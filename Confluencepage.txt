Hi Team,

Good afternoon.

As discussed, we are planning a **production release tomorrow (Thursday)** related to the **User Recertification / User Table automation** activity.

For the smooth execution of this release, we request your support for the following:

**1. Database Backup (Mandatory)**

* Kindly take a **full database backup** before starting the release activity.
* Backup will be required prior to executing any DB changes.

**2. Application Server Support (If Required)**

* During the release window, there may be a need for:

  * Configuration updates on application servers (if any)
  * Manual intervention in case the automated pipeline execution faces any issues
* Hence, we request **DBA / application support availability between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM**.

Please note:

* No user access changes are planned as part of this activity.
* The activity is controlled and part of a planned production dry run.

Kindly let us know if the above support window works for you or if any additional information is required from our side.

Thanks & Regards,
Krishna Chaitanya

If you want, I can also:

* make this **more formal** (CAB / Infra head style), or
* shorten it for **Teams / Outlook quick approval**

Just tell me 👍
