Hi Matt,

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to take a moment to formally introduce myself. I have been working on the RAP project since 2020/2021, supporting the platform across development, enhancements, production support, and overall application stability.

Over the past few years, I have worked closely with the HSBC stakeholders and delivery teams to ensure continuity and reliability of the platform, especially during periods of transition. I’ve enjoyed being part of the RAP program and contributing to its long-term success.

Last year, there were initial discussions around longer-term engagement, but due to timing and planning considerations, things did not progress further at that point. I wanted to share this context with you so you’re aware of my background and continued involvement with the project.

I look forward to continuing to work with you and supporting the RAP platform. Please feel free to let me know if there’s anything I can assist with or if there’s any guidance you’d like to share as we move forward.

Best regards,
R Krishna Chaitanya
