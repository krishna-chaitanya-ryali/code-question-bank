Hi Team,

As we will be on leave for the next couple of days, I wanted to share a quick status update on the User Recertification changes in both UAT and Production.

✅ UAT Environment

- Line Manager Revoke Job is scheduled to run every 1 hour.
- System Revoke Job is scheduled to run once daily at 10:00 AM.
- These timings are configurable and can be changed if required.

✅ Production – Database Changes

- All required table and column changes have been completed.
- DB changes are already updated in the CRM.

✅ Production – Code Status

- Production-ready code is available in:
  - Testing UAT branch
  - Testing UAT common branch
- I have also shared the production-ready code with Prasan.
- When Prasan raises the upcoming CRM (Friday or Monday) for another fix, our code will also be included in that release.

ℹ Current Production Behavior

- The scheduler-related revoke logic is currently commented in production.
- Once we are ready to activate it in PROD, the commented lines can be uncommented.

(I will paste the exact code snippet below this mail for reference.)

🔍 Line Manager Specific Testing

- For production validation with specific line managers, we are not enabling all line managers by default.
- We can selectively update required line managers using the below query:

(I will paste the query below this mail.)

Please let me know if any timing changes are required or if further clarification is needed.

Regards,
R Krishna Chaitanya
