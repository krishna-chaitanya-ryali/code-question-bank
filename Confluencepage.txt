Hi Team,

Good morning.

We are planning to perform a production dry run release for the User Recertification enhancements on 27th.

As part of the standard deployment procedure, we request a full database backup to be taken prior to executing the production deployment activities.

Kindly confirm the availability to take the backup before the deployment window begins. We will coordinate the exact time accordingly.

Although the system revoke and reminder triggers are scheduled for early March, the application logic changes are being deployed on 27th. Hence, we would like to ensure a backup is available before proceeding with the release.

Please let us know if any additional details are required from our end.

Thanks & Regards,
R Krishna Chaitanya
