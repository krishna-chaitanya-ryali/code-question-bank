Hi Team,

Quick heads-up on today’s deployment plan (high-level):

1. 08:30 AM — DBA (Srikanth) will start the production DB schema backup (expected ~30–45 mins).


2. Before / During backup — Stop DRN production server to ensure consistency.


3. After backup completes — Krishna / Prasad will execute the approved DB scripts and apply required configuration changes on application & database servers (estimated ~2–3 hrs).


4. Post DB changes — Run the DR pipelines followed by the Production pipeline.


5. Validation — Perform functional validations and health checks to confirm all changes are successful.



Notes:

This is a high-level plan — will share detailed checklist if needed.

Please flag immediately if you anticipate any blockers or delays.
