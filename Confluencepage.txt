Short Description

Production database data corrections to support access flow updates and master data alignment

Description

This database change request is raised to perform controlled, one-time data-level corrections in the production environment to support updated access flow behavior and resolve data inconsistencies.

The change includes:

Corrective updates to access-related records for specific impacted users

Cleanup or adjustment of records in access management tables to ensure proper access lifecycle handling

Required master/dropdown data updates and value corrections to align with current business logic

These changes are data-only in nature and do not involve any schema modifications or application code changes. All updates will be executed using validated SQL scripts during the approved change window.

This is a planned data maintenance activity and not related to any active production incident.

Why is this change being done?

To support corrected access removal and re-provisioning behavior

To resolve data inconsistencies impacting access requests

To ensure data integrity and consistency in production

To avoid repeated manual intervention for access-related issues

Implementation Plan

Obtain approved DB change window and access.

Identify impacted records/users.

Take pre-change data backups (SELECT snapshots).

Execute validated SQL scripts:

Access-related data corrections

Required data cleanup or updates

Master/dropdown value updates (if applicable)

Verify affected row counts.

Commit changes and capture execution evidence.

Business Impact During Implementation

No customer-facing impact

No downtime expected

Changes are backend data corrections only

Technical Impact During Implementation

No application restart

No schema changes

Limited to specific records

Minimal database load

Backout Plan

Restore affected records from pre-change backups

Revert changes using rollback scripts if required

Validate data restoration

Post-Implementation Verification

Validate corrected records using SELECT queries

Confirm access-related data behaves as expected

Obtain confirmation from support/business teams

Release Plan

Standalone production database change

Executed during approved change window

No application release dependency

🟢 CHANGE REQUEST 2: PIPELINE / SOFTWARE CHANGE REQUEST
Short Description

Execution of DR and Production pipelines to deploy validated access flow updates

Description

This change request is raised to execute the approved CI/CD pipelines to deploy validated application changes related to access flow improvements.

The change involves:

Executing the DR pipeline as per standard deployment procedure

Executing the Production pipeline post DR validation

Performing required post-deployment validations to ensure correct application behavior

No emergency fixes are involved. This is a planned software change following standard release and deployment practices.

Why is this change being done?

To deploy validated access flow logic changes to production

To align production behavior with tested lower environments

To ensure consistent and correct access lifecycle handling

Implementation Plan

Obtain approved change window.

Trigger and complete the DR pipeline.

Validate application behavior in DR.

Trigger the Production pipeline.

Monitor deployment logs and pipeline execution.

Perform application-level validations.

Confirm successful deployment.

Business Impact During Implementation

No expected business disruption

No user-facing downtime

Deployment performed during approved window

Technical Impact During Implementation

Application services updated via pipeline

No database schema impact

Standard deployment risk only

Backout Plan

Revert to previous stable application version using rollback pipeline

Validate service stability post-rollback

Inform stakeholders if rollback is executed

Post-Implementation Verification

Validate access removal and re-provisioning flow

Confirm impacted users can raise access requests

Monitor logs for errors

Obtain confirmation from support team

Release Plan

Deployment via standard CI/CD pipelines

DR pipeline followed by Production pipeline

Post-deployment verification before change closure
