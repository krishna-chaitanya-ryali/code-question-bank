Hi Nitin, just a quick update before the 3:30 call.
The onboarding template was originally designed in 2020 only to capture the basic layer of a pack, not the full detailed RAP structure. The entire 7-step onboarding process (Excel macros, UI validations, staging tables, inserts, mappings) is tightly coupled to the current 12-column format.

So adding new columns or renaming existing ones is not a plug-and-play Excel change — it will require end-to-end modifications across all onboarding steps. I will explain this in the call.**


One more important point I want to highlight is the original intention behind the onboarding template.
When this template was designed in 2020, the idea was not to capture the full end-to-end detailed RAP design.
It was created only to capture the basic foundational layer of the pack — meaning: basic metric information, basic risk type mapping, and the minimal columns required to onboard a country.

It was never designed as a dynamic or expandable template where new fields can be frequently added.
This is why the structure is very rigid and tightly coupled with the 7-step onboarding logic.

Because of that original design philosophy, the template is not naturally suitable for quick enhancements.
If we touch or expand this structure now — whether by adding 3 new columns or renaming existing columns — it will require modifications across all 7 steps:

Excel macro validations

UI validations

Risk type tagging

Staging tables

Backend inserts into RAP tables

Mapping logic

Formula validations

So it’s not just an Excel change; it is a complete end-to-end redesign of the onboarding process.
