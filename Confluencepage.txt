Short Description
Production DB Changes – User Recertification Enhancements (Schema & Data Preparation)
Description
This change request is to implement database-related changes required for the User Recertification production dry run.
The scope includes:
Creation of new columns related to recertification tracking.
Creation/validation of required supporting tables.
Updates to selected production user records for dry run testing.
Ensuring proper indexing and constraints remain intact.
Pre-deployment database backup.
These changes are necessary to support the backend recertification logic, scheduler execution, and reporting functionality.
Purpose of Change / Why is this Change Required?
The database changes are required to:
Support User Recertification workflow in Production.
Store recertification email trigger history.
Maintain system revoke completion status.
Enable UI checkbox logic to reflect recertification completion.
Support Line Manager detail population.
Without these DB changes, the application enhancements cannot function correctly.
