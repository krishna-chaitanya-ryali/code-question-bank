Subject: UAT Sign-Off Request – User Recertification and Inactive User Revocation Feature

Hi Sandeep,

Hope you’re doing well.

This is to inform you that the User Recertification module — including the scheduler logic and related enhancements — has been successfully deployed in the UAT environment.

As part of this feature, we have implemented the following key functionalities:

User Recertification workflow: Automatically validates whether each user still requires access to RAP or Pack Builder, based on line manager responses.

Scheduler implementation: Periodically checks the RECREATE_RESPONSE table for line manager feedback.

If the Access Status is Revoked, the scheduler updates the respective records by setting:

isActive = 1 in the source table (RECREATE_RESPONSE)

for_rap = 1 in the destination table (USER_TAB)

Data consistency enhancements: Additional logic and validations to ensure synchronization between the response and user tables.

Support for both Flask-based backend scheduling and standalone script execution (for Control-M integration).

Request you to please perform the necessary validations and provide your UAT sign-off confirmation.
Kindly let us know if any issues are observed during your testing or if further clarifications are needed.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,
R. Krishna Chaitanya
