Issue Type: Enhancement
(or Story, based on your Jira setup)
Summary:
Restrict RAP menu hierarchy visibility based on user pack access
Description:
Currently, in the RAP application, users can view the entire menu hierarchy (Group, Region, Global Business, all countries and packs) even if they have access to only a single pack.
Example of current behavior:
User has access only to India pack.
Still able to see:
All Regions (Asia-Pacific, EMEA, Americas, etc.)
All countries under Asia-Pacific (Hong Kong, Australia, China, etc.)
All Global Business packs (HBUK, MS Bank, HSBC, Innovation Bank, etc.)
This creates confusion and unnecessary visibility of packs that the user is not authorized to access.
Expected Behavior:
Menu visibility should be restricted based on user pack access, as follows:
User should see only the hierarchy path relevant to their assigned pack.
Example:
If user has access to India:
Show: Region → Asia-Pacific → India
Do not show:
Other countries under Asia-Pacific
Other regions
Global Business packs (if no access exists)
If user has no access to Global Business packs:
Global Business section should not be visible in the menu.
Actual Behavior:
All menu hierarchies and packs are visible, irrespective of user access.
Access control is applied only at the data level, not at the menu visibility level.
Impact:
Poor user experience due to cluttered menu.
Confusion for users seeing packs they cannot access.
Increased risk of incorrect navigation or access requests.
Proposed Enhancement:
Filter menu hierarchy dynamically based on:
User’s assigned pack(s)
Parent-child hierarchy (Region → Country → Pack)
Display only relevant nodes in the hierarchy tree.
Priority:
Medium (Backlog item – UX & access improvement)
Environment:
All (RAP Application)
