Hi Sandeep,

Sure, we will not make any changes to user access as part of this activity.

Please find below the proposed **IT action plan for the production dry run** of the ERR User Recertification process, planned for Thursday:

**Prod Deployment**

* **8th – 9:00 AM**

**Mail Notifications**

* **First Mail Reminder:** 8th – 4:00 PM
* **Second Mail Reminder:** 9th – 4:00 PM
* **Final Mail Reminder:** 12th – 4:00 PM

**Non-Recertified User Revocation**

* **13th – 5:00 PM**

As discussed, this dry run will be executed only for the **identified limited set of users/line managers**, purely for validation purposes.

Please let us know if any changes are required in the above plan or if anything is missing from our side.

Thanks & Regards,
Krishna Chaitanya
