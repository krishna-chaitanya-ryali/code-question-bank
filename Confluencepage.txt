Bishmoy,
I reviewed the email thread and could not find any specific error message, screenshot, or confirmation on which ERR link the user is accessing to raise WRAP access. The Confluence link shared contains multiple scenarios.
Before we classify this as an access issue, could you please confirm with the user:
The exact ERR URL being accessed
Whether the “Risk Appetite Profile Access Request” option is visible under Access Request
A screenshot if the option is not visible
If the user confirms they are using the correct ERR link and still cannot see the option, we can then treat this as an access issue and proceed further.
