Good evening. I’m R. Krishna Chaitanya, a Python full stack developer from Hyderabad with around 10 years of experience in backend and web development.

My primary expertise is in Python, Flask, and FastAPI, where I’ve built and managed REST APIs and data-driven applications.

I also work with SQL, JavaScript, and have hands-on experience in AWS services like Lambda and S3.

For the last few years, I’ve been contributing to a long-term project focused on backend optimization and API integration.

I’m now looking for an opportunity at TCS to contribute my full stack skills and grow in a technically challenging environment.

My core expertise lies in Python, Flask, and FastAPI, where I’ve been involved in building scalable REST APIs, backend services, and data-driven applications.

I’ve been working on my current project for about four years, where I handle API design, database modeling, and integration with front-end components. On the front-end side, I’ve worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic React, primarily focusing on creating clean and efficient interfaces that connect seamlessly with the backend.

I have also worked on SQL, including writing complex queries, optimizing performance, and managing data migrations. Additionally, I’m experienced in AWS services such as Lambda, S3, and KMS, and have exposure to CI/CD pipelines for deployments.
