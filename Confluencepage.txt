Subject: UAT Sign-Off Request – User Recertification & Super Admin Enhancements

Hi Sandeep,

Good Morning.

The User Recertification feature and related components have been successfully deployed to the UAT environment for validation.
This enhancement ensures that inactive or revoked users are automatically managed within the system based on the line manager’s response.

Below is a summary of the key changes included in this UAT deployment:

User Recertification Scheduler

A scheduler job is configured to run periodically to identify users whose access is revoked by their respective line managers.

The scheduler updates corresponding user records in both the USER_TAB and RECREATE_RESPONSE tables.

Additionally, a manual trigger option is provided to initiate the scheduler instantly during UAT testing (without waiting for the scheduled job run).

Super Admin Portal Enhancements

Introduced a Super Admin dashboard accessible to designated users (e.g., you and selected business users).

Added a report download option for the User Recertification data from the RECREATE_RESPONSE table.

Super Admins can now generate yearly reports (e.g., 2024, 2025, etc.) to review all user access decisions—approved, revoked, or pending—without developer dependency.

Stability & Backend Improvements

Integrated the scheduler into the Flask backend for smoother automation.

Provided a standalone script version compatible with Control-M for future production automation.

Kindly review the functionality and confirm the UAT sign-off so we can proceed with the production deployment.

Thanks & Regards,
