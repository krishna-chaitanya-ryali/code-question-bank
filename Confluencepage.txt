Hi Sandeep,

I wanted to bring to your notice that currently, only three developers are actively working on the RAP application, handling both enhancements and production issues.

At present, the team’s bandwidth is already fully occupied with ongoing sprint tasks and additional changes suggested during this sprint. Moreover, most of the team members will be on leave next week due to Diwali, which will further reduce our available capacity.

Whenever I try to assign any additional tasks — whether production tickets or other requests — the common feedback from everyone is that they are already fully engaged. Considering this, it might be difficult to take up new activities alongside current sprint commitments.

It would be good to either plan for additional support or defer some of these new changes to the next sprint. This will help us maintain both timely delivery and quality.

Thanks for your understanding and support.
