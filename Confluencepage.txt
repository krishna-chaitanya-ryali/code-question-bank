For enabling access, please ask them to complete the following steps:

Raise a SNOW request (if not already available).

Request access through the Access Management Portal for the newly onboarded HCIBUS Branch pack.

Once the access requests are approved, we will proceed with enabling the required roles.

Could you please confirm under which parent RMM you would like this newly onboarded RMM (HCIBUS Branch) to be added? Based on your confirmation, we will update the hierarchy accordingly.
