PART 1: JIRA TICKET (Fix / Improvement – NOT Incident)
Issue Type

Task (or Change / Improvement, not Incident, not Bug if your org is strict)

Summary

Fix access removal flow to allow re-request of access for impacted users

Description

Currently, when a user is removed from the RAP application, the access removal logic updates the EZAC2 flag to 0 in the relevant tables. However, for certain users, existing records in the METRIC_ACCESS table prevent them from raising access requests again.

This behavior is causing access re-provisioning issues for a limited set of users, even though they are no longer active in the application.

A revised approach has been tested successfully in the unit environment, where access removal is handled in a way that ensures:

Existing access records do not block future access requests

Access re-provisioning works as expected

This ticket tracks the production implementation of the validated solution for impacted users only.

Impact

Affects only specific users facing access re-request issues

No impact to existing valid users

No application downtime

Environment

Production (implementation via approved Change Request)

Acceptance Criteria

Impacted users can successfully raise access requests after removal

No unintended access is retained

No regression to existing access flows

🟢 PART 2: CHANGE REQUEST (CR) – FULL CONTENT
Short Description

Production update to access removal flow to enable re-provisioning for impacted users

Description

This change request is raised to implement a corrective update to the RAP application’s access removal flow.

Currently, when users are removed from RAP, access is revoked by setting the EZAC2 flag to 0. However, for some users, existing records in the METRIC_ACCESS table prevent them from requesting access again, resulting in access re-provisioning failures.

A revised solution has been validated in the unit environment, ensuring proper cleanup/handling of access records so that users can re-request access without issues. This change will apply the same validated logic in the production environment for identified impacted users only.

This is a planned data correction / access flow fix, not an incident response.

Why is this change being done? (Business Justification)

To resolve access re-provisioning issues faced by specific users

To align production behavior with validated access logic

To ensure correct lifecycle handling of user access

To prevent repeated manual intervention for access-related issues

Implementation Plan (Implementation Change Request)

Obtain approved change window and necessary access.

Identify impacted users based on approved criteria.

Log in to the production database server.

Take pre-change backups (SELECT snapshots) of impacted records.

Execute validated SQL queries to:

Correct access records in METRIC_ACCESS

Ensure access removal does not block future access requests

Verify affected row counts.

Commit the changes.

Capture logs/screenshots for audit.

Customer / Business Impact During Implementation

No customer-facing impact

No downtime expected

Changes are limited to backend access data

Improvement will be visible only when users re-request access

Technical Impact During Implementation

No application restart required

No schema or code changes

Limited to specific user records

Minimal database load

Backout Plan (Backout Change Request)

If any issue is observed:

Stop further execution.

Restore pre-change data using backup snapshots.

Revert modified access records to original state.

Validate restoration using SELECT queries.

Inform stakeholders after rollback completion.

Post-Implementation Verification Plan (PIV Change Request)

Validate updated access records in METRIC_ACCESS.

Confirm impacted users can raise access requests.

Ensure no unintended access remains.

Obtain confirmation from support or business teams.

Close the change after validation.

Release Plan

Standalone production data fix

No application release involved

Executed during approved change window

Post-verification confirmation to stakeholders
