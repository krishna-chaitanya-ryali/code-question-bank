Subject: Discussion on High-Level Solution Options for Global RAP Metric Automation

Hi Srikaran,

Hope you’re doing well.

As part of the action items from the recent RAP Tool Automation discussion, I’d like to schedule a short meeting with you to go over the high-level architectural approach and feasibility for the Global RAP Metric Automation.

The idea is to review possible solution options and get your inputs on the best-fit approach from an architectural standpoint.

Please let me know your availability this week so I can schedule the discussion accordingly.

Thanks & Regards,
R. Krishna Chaitanya
