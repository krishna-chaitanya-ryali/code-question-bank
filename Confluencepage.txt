Title
One-time setup & execution of manager update script for User Recertification (RAP)
Description
As part of the User Recertification activity, we need to perform a one-time update of manager details directly in the RAP database (ZTAB table).
To ensure security compliance and avoid manual handling of credentials, support is required from the Linux / DB team to set up and execute the script in the application server environment.
Scope of Work
Copy Script to Server
Clone / copy the provided script folder from the approved GitHub repository
Place it in the appropriate RAP application directory on the server
Environment & Configuration Setup
Use existing RAP configuration (.env / encrypted credentials)
Ensure the script runs under the same service account as the RAP application
No plaintext passwords to be shared or exposed
Script Execution
Execute the Python script to update manager details in the ZTAB table
Script will only perform the required UPDATE statements
This is a one-time execution
Post-Execution Cleanup
Remove the script folder from the server
Clear / delete any temporary configuration files if created
No persistence of credentials beyond existing application setup
Impact / Risk
Low risk
One-time controlled update
No impact to application runtime
No credential exposure
Validation
Record count before and after update
Spot verification of updated manager records
Environment
☐ PROD (confirm)
☐ UAT (if required before PROD)
Attachments
GitHub repository link (to be attached)
Script execution steps (optional)
Request
Please assist with:
Server-level setup
