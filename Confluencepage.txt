CR–1: Database Change Request (DB)
Short Description

User Recertification – Database enhancements to support system-driven revoke and annual recertification tracking.

Description

This change introduces database-level enhancements to support automated user recertification and system-driven revoke functionality. The changes include adding new tracking columns, updating recertification status handling, and ensuring proper auditability for annual recertification cycles.

These changes are required to reliably identify users who have not responded to recertification requests and to mark recertification completion once system revoke is executed.

Why is this change required

To support automated system revoke after multiple reminder emails and a defined waiting period.

To ensure recertification runs only once per year, avoiding duplicate revokes.

To provide clear audit visibility of recertification completion status.

To eliminate manual tracking and reduce operational risk.

Scope / List of Database Changes

Add new columns to RECERTIFICATION_EMAIL_LIST:

SYSTEM_REVOKE_DONE_IND CHAR(1) (Default: 'N')

SYSTEM_REVOKE_DONE_DT TIMESTAMP

Update queries to:

Identify users eligible for system revoke (based on email count + elapsed days).

Mark recertification completion after system revoke.

Ensure queries handle cross-year scenarios correctly (Dec → Jan).

No existing data deletion or modification outside recertification scope.

Implementation Plan

Take pre-change database backup.

Add new columns to RECERTIFICATION_EMAIL_LIST.

Deploy updated SQL queries used by the application.

Validate column defaults and existing data integrity.

Grant required privileges (if applicable).

Technical Impact

Low risk

Schema-level change only

No impact to unrelated tables or queries

Changes are backward compatible

Business Impact

Improves compliance with annual access review policies.

Reduces manual intervention for recertification tracking.

Ensures consistent enforcement of access governance.

Customer Impact

No direct customer-facing impact.

Improves security posture and access hygiene.

Verification / Testing Plan

Verify new columns exist with correct defaults.

Validate select queries return correct eligible records.

Confirm update query marks SYSTEM_REVOKE_DONE_IND = 'Y' correctly.

Confirm no unintended rows are updated.

Backout / Rollback Plan

Restore database from pre-change backup.

Drop newly added columns if required.

Post-Implementation Verification

Monitor recertification data for correct status updates.

Confirm no repeat system revoke for same year.

Validate audit trail timestamps.

🔹 CR–2: Software / Pipeline Change Request
Short Description

User Recertification – Application and pipeline changes for system-driven revoke execution.

Description

This change implements application-level logic and scheduled job updates to support automated system-driven user revoke as part of annual recertification. The change ensures system revoke runs only once per year and updates recertification status upon completion.

Pipeline execution is required to deploy updated backend logic and scheduler configuration to the target environments.

Why is this change required

To automate revocation of user access when line managers do not respond.

To ensure recertification logic is time-bound and non-repetitive.

To prevent repeated revokes across multiple scheduler runs.

To align application behavior with governance and audit requirements.

Scope / List of Software Changes

Backend logic to:

Identify users eligible for system revoke.

Execute revoke (delete/update access records).

Update recertification completion status.

Scheduler job changes:

Ensure system revoke runs only once per recertification cycle.

Prevent re-execution once marked completed.

Frontend:

Display read-only “User Recertification” checkbox based on backend status.

No update actions from UI.

Pipeline execution for deployment to UAT / PROD.

Implementation Plan

Deploy updated backend code.

Deploy updated scheduler configuration.

Run application pipelines in target environment.

Validate scheduler initialization and job execution.

Monitor logs for successful completion.

Technical Impact

Low to medium (controlled scheduler logic).

No API contract changes.

No UI write operations introduced.

Business Impact

Ensures access recertification is enforced consistently.

Reduces dependency on manual revocation.

Improves audit readiness.

Customer Impact

No visible UI disruption.

Users may see access revoked only if recertification is not completed.

Verification / Testing Plan

Trigger scheduler in test mode (UAT).

Verify eligible users are identified correctly.

Confirm revoke actions are executed once.

Validate recertification checkbox reflects correct status.

Ensure scheduler does not rerun for same year.

Backout / Rollback Plan

Revert application code via pipeline rollback.

Disable scheduler job if required.

Restore DB data from backup (if applicable).

Post-Implementation Verification

Confirm scheduler logs show single execution.

Validate no repeat system revoke.

Verify UI status reflects backend state.

Monitor application logs for errors.
