Hi [Name],

Thank you for your response.

I would like to clarify that this request is **not an incident** but a **planned, controlled change request for production data correction**, raised under service protection.

The reference to *“incorrect / stale HR data”* is to explain the **root cause** of the issue and not an indication of an active production incident. There is **no ongoing outage, degradation, or user impact** at present. The application is functioning as expected.

This change is being raised to:

* Correct previously identified **data inconsistencies**
* Clean up obsolete access records
* Update master/dropdown values to align with current business requirements

All activities are:

* **Data-only changes** (no code or schema changes)
* **One-time corrective actions**
* Executed in a **controlled change window**
* Fully reversible with a defined backout plan

Since this is a **preventive and corrective data maintenance activity** and not a live incident resolution, it has been raised as a **change request** rather than an incident. Classifying this as an incident would require emergency handling, which is not applicable in this case.

Hence, we are requesting **exception approval** to proceed under service protection, avoiding unnecessary incident and HR approval workflows, while still maintaining full audit and governance compliance.

Please let me know if any additional clarification is required. I’ll be happy to provide further details.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Regards,
R Krishna Chaitanya

### 💡 Optional tip (don’t send, just for you)

If she still pushes back:

* Emphasize **“no customer impact”**
* Use the phrase **“preventive data correction”**
* Avoid words like *issue, failure, problem* — stick to *correction, alignment, cleanup*

If you want, I can:

* Make this **shorter** (some approvers prefer 4–5 lines)
* Make it **more authoritative** (policy-driven tone)
* Rewrite it to match **ITIL / CAB language** used in your org

Just tell me 👍
