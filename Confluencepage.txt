2. Access Management Enhancement Fix

During usage, an issue was observed in the access management flow affecting a small set of users when re-requesting access.

As part of today’s release, the access logic has been stabilized by reverting to the previously validated logic, ensuring consistent behavior for all users.

Invalid or stale access requests were cleaned up as part of this activity.

Required viewer access has been provided wherever access gaps were identified.

The access management flow is now working as expected.


3. Metrics Data Update – Missing Metrics

Database-level updates were applied to address the missing metrics.

The changes are deployed and ready for user validation.
